# **Bargain Bin Beats**
Bargain Bin Beats is an interactive music player built to help users discover new music. After inputting up to three genres they wish to see, users are treated to a huge pool of songs to swipe through. Each song automatically plays a short preview to help them decide if they want to keep it, or throw it away. If the user loves the song, they can add it to their playlist by pressing the "add" button or swiping to the right; if they don't, swiping to the left or pressing skip discards the song, allowing them to move on to the next. When they are satisfied with their collection, clicking done shows off their new playlist. From the end screen, the user can either restart or export their playlist to spotify.

# Our Goals
When first starting our project we had a few features we wanted to implement:
[x] Random songs from the Spotify API
[x] Genre selection
[x] Swiping
[x] Exporting playlists to Spotify
[] Saving playlists locally

## Getting Started
Modifying our project requires the Flutter framework. Visit the [Flutter Install Page](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwoa2xBhACEiwA1sb1BEl_EE9_hc6iC4FWZ_pqyJeOjE9lnMiZd5whcc7HBb6hdIsvJ3yMGBoCTZsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) to download it.
